        <h2>Meet Bruce</h2>
        <p>My name is Bruce Elgort. I work as a consultant, software developer, speaker and college instructor.</p>
        <p>I really enjoy what I do and have been running my own business for two decades. Recently I have reopened the consultancy part of my business and I'm ready to assist you and your company with information technology related issues.</p>
        <p>My promise is that you will like working with me. I am open, honest, and will provide the necessary challenges and opportunities to help you and your company meet your organizational goals. I am not a yes-man and if I do not see how I can help, I will refer you to somebody else.</p>
        <p>I have experience serving both small and large organizations. In fact, I served as the IT and Office Services Manager for Underwriters Laboratories from 1991-1998 and as the IT Manager for SHARP Microelectronics of the Americas from 1998-2010. I'm now teaching web development classes at Clark College located in Vancouver, Washington.</p>
        <p>More importantly, I'm looking forward to serving you.</p>

      <blockquote>"Bruce is a man with big ideas who knows how to get to reality. He is a leader who energizes, executes, and markets. He does not wait for things to happen -- he makes them happen. From OpenNTF.org -- an open-source community that Bruce was one of the two people who envisioned, created, promoted, and ultimately succeeded at energizing -- to IdeaJam/Elguji, Bruce has made a difference in the marketplace for IBM Lotus software. I am eternally grateful for that leadership, and I know many of my customers and partners are as well."

          "I've known Bruce for 20 years.  Initially, we brought Bruce in to assist us with internal system issues which he addressed promptly and completely.  Given that success, we brought him in to a key client to address a variety of IT infrastructure and software development issues.   Our client immediately saw Bruce's value and over the course of the next 15 years, they sought his help to address some of their most complex and strategic projects."
